viddy-raster
============

just put all of our devices together and make a program that rasterized video

you just have a GUI, and you draw rectangles on an image to represent where your devices are

then it streams that portion on that device

even better

arrange your monitors, send picture of arrangementto program

it handles (most of) the rest
